This is original work of Harsh Rawat (CSLogin: harsh-rawat and netid: hrawat2) and Sidharth Gurbani (CSLogin: gurbani and netid: gurbani) for Assignment 3 (CS 537 Fall 2020).

Problem Description-
-------------------
This project entails building a simple version of make command.
Our command called make537 will read a makefile and following the specifications in the file, it will execute commands.


Usage
-----
Run the following command in the source folder to build the project-
"make all"

Then run the executable using-
"make537"
or
"make537 <target>"
or
"make537 -f <makefile_name>"
or
"make537 -f <makefile_name> <target>"

Problem Solution-
----------------
The entire problem has been divided into 2 parts-
1. Building an execution graph
2. Executing the graph

*** Building an execution graph
This part of the project involves-
- Parsing the makefile into rules. In case of error, we raise appropriate error.
- Building a graph structure from the rules. Each rule has a vertex and is connected to other dependent rule vertexes using edges.
- The result of this part is a graph which encapsulates the makefile specification.
- We then test if the built graph has any cycles.

*** Executing the graph
This part of the project involves-
- Traversing the graph in the post order manner and executing the rules.
- The rules are executed based on make rules.
- In case of any error, we raise appropriate error and exit.

Different parts of the solution-
--------------------------------
-- linked_list module
It is an implementation of the linked list data structure.

-- graph module
It is an implementation of the graph data structure

-- text_parser module
It parses each line from the makefile. It also checks for the errors which can occur while parsing the lines.

-- makefile_parser module
It parses the makefile to generate an execution graph. It is also responsible to detect any cycles existent in the graph.

-- execution_engine module
It is responsible for taking the execution graph and execute the specifications as per the make rules.

-- error_handler module
It is responsible for all the error handling in the project
